animation
(1 pts) Body tilt up (’u’).
(2 pts) Body tilt down (’e’). 
(2 pts) Head move left (’g’).
(2 pts) Head move right (’h’).
(2 pts) Tail move right (’t’).

Had problem with combination of animation, everything resets to default when tilting body, 
tried using global variable to save positions of head and other body parts after moving them but did not work

had problem with adding 2nd and 3rd swim animation, tried to make different cases for 
2nd and 3rd key press but did not work.
